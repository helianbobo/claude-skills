## Word Selection Algorithm

When selecting daily words, prioritize:
1. Words from learner's current level
2. Words that connect to recently learned vocabulary
3. Words useful for upcoming themes/topics
4. Mix of word types: 2-3 content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) + 1-2 function words

### Difficulty Scoring
```
difficulty_score = (frequency_rank / 1000) + level_modifier + abstract_bonus

where:
- frequency_rank: word's position in frequency list (lower = more common)
- level_modifier: +0.5 per level above learner's current level
- abstract_bonus: +0.3 for abstract concepts, +0 for concrete words
```
